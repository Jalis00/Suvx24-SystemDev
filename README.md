# Suvx24-SystemDev

Welcome to my repository! This is where I collect all my work from the **System Developer C/C++ Extended 2024–2026** program at **Chas Academy**, class **Suvx24**.

The repository includes both course-related assignments and independent projects I've created outside the curriculum. Everything is organized by course for easy navigation.
